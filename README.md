# tmatsolver
An easy to use interface for TMATROM for multiple scattering simulations using the T-matrix.

To install:

1) First install the TMATROM package from https://github.com/stuart-hawkins/tmatrom

2) Download this package (TMATSOLVER) to your computer.

3) In Matlab change the working directory to the location of the package.

4) In Matlab run setpath_tmatsolver.

The example EXAMPLES/tmatsolver_demo.m is a good place to start to understand and use the code.

The Matlab live scripts in LIVESCRIPTS demonstrate the features of the code and how it works.
